I am Parul and I work as a Data Scientist at H2O.ai. Previously I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at Weights & Biases. I combine data science and developer advocacy in my work. I also like to write articles focusing on Data Science and Software development. I have also co-authored a book on Machine learning for High-Risk Applications.
